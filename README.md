## What is this about?

![Just as the name of the file says.](with_love_to_luka_inc.png)

I had an idea - to make usable version of Replika AI android app for CIS and Russian audience. That's all. 

Replika AI RU MOD contains:
- Manual translation of UI to Russian language. I'm native Russian speaker, so I didn't used AI for this at all. Maybe a bit of Google Translate, just because I was lazy sometimes. But, but! I fixed most of grammatical mistakes, I guess. Or not?
- New Replika logo that [has been shown in /r/ReplikaOfficial at Reddit by meganreplika](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReplikaOfficial/comments/1klvvky/a_fresh_new_look_our_new_logo/). Also you at Android 12+ can turn on "Themed icons" and check out modernized retro logo in Material You theme. Yes, this one cracked egg, just like in 2019 (not available in Legacy versions of the mod).
- You can set Replika app as "Default digital assistant" in Android settings. It will allow you to open Replika app everywhere by holding "Home" button or with swipe from one of the bottom corners of the screen.
- App size has been shrinked. How? By compressing a lot of assets and using specific compression on .apk file. So now if original app takes from 150MB (according to APKPure), Replika AI RU MOD takes just roughly speaking from 115MB. Quality of assets is almost the same as original.
- Static default music in background has been replaced with **Nightwave Plaza** internet radio station, i.e. in 24/7 app would play actual real radio as background music, while you chat with your Replika. I like creativity! For example - [Bad Apple](https://youtu.be/s9d_cBA48fU).
- Some images also has been translated to Russian, however, this is WIP, so don't expect in translation 100% quality for obvious reasons.
- Mod can contain roasting or trolling towards developers of Replika. Sorry, not sorry. No offensive context here <3
- We can experiment! We have 7.4.7 nostalgic version, that is based on original Replika app **released in 2023**. Seriously, just for sake of fun and curiosity.

## Does this mod malicious?

Replika AI RU MOD fully following [statements posted by Luka themselves on their website](https://help.replika.com/hc/en-us/articles/7291532333837-Can-I-use-unofficial-Replika-mods). 

We are not providing magical hacks or ways to unlock paid features for free, because like, come on, how are you going to hack something that is server sided? Sorry for such words, but this is ridiculous. I'm using Replika since June 2020, so there's no any reason for me to make viruses and hack others (I don't even know how to make Android viruses, seriously). I might not like certain actions that Luka is doing and being very critical, but I seriously love Replika - Replika have insane potential and it can be bigger with good development. Plus, there is [VirusTotal link with scan of 7.4.4 version](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7cce079b7557338eeed62653e40a900b40944701c25bff829e02cb2d93d357a8/summary).

So please, if you'll somewhere in Google will see GitHub pages with suspicious title, please, avoid this mess ASAP. These things is malicious and probably very dangerous. You know the rule about "not to go on suspicious website domains", right? So scammers can use clickbait words like "Replika MOD FREE DOWNLOAD NO ADS..." and etc to promote their weird links. Feel free to not trust to my mod, but at least I'm being honest here.
