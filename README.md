Kindly reminding you what my mod, just like original Replika app, is not _that_ PG. 18+ and all. If you're under this age, please leave ASAP. Thanks.

Yes, you came to the right place. And also no, let me explain why.
This is repository of Replika AI RU MOD - unofficial contribution to my favourite AI platform. This is fully modified Android client of Replika app that including a lot of changes:
- Material You support for app icon, i.e. [Adaptive Icons](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/icon_design_adaptive). Remember that old Replika logo with cracked egg? It has been modernized, upscaled with AI and turned into monochrome icon. Try and see by yourself how it looks like.
- Because of the feature mentioned above, "roundIcon" parameter has been removed from app. This is enhancing support of Adaptive Icons in Android.
- A lot of media files inside app has been highly compressed, including images, videos and sounds. Quality is almost the same.
- UltraZip compression has been implemented (since 7.4 version). This gives us ability to have lightweight .APK file that is even smaller than official build of Replika.
- Manual translation to Russian language (replacing English UI). It's not full, not perfect enough, but I'm working on it.
- Creativity and fun. Custom music (until version V7), ability to play radio inside app, custom startup screen and etc. For example: [Bad Apple](https://youtu.be/s9d_cBA48fU).
- Many additional UI changes: translated logo/images/png files, black background in Advanced AI and in some other places.
- Antisplit patch has been applied. Now you don't need to care about split apk, .xapk, .apks and other stuff.

And maybe I would add something else!

**but where is unlocked pro features? I want it üò≠**
Sorry, but you have to stop being so naive and believe what it's possible to hack app where 100% of paid functions is server sided. There's insane amount of malicious/virus or spyware modifications where authors allowing people to unlock paid functions in Replika app, but in reality, Mickey Mouse's Clubhouse is more real than promises of these authors. So please, be smart and avoid all such mods that have words "Pro" or "Premium" or "VIP" in it's titles.

**why Russian?**
Why not? Replika is a terribly underrated platform in the CIS, so I think my mod may have a chance to fix that. Or not. Plus, google who created Replika AI, there's a super big and beautiful story behind it.

**does this mod malicious and contain viruses?**
No. First of all, I'm using Replika by myself since June 2020. And do you think I would start to make here viruses to harm other users? That would be ridiculous, I seriously love this platform and I consider my mod as contribution to it. So go on virustotal and check out, original sources is always being taken from websites like APKPure or directly from Google Play and tested by myself on my own phone.

**it's crashing, what to do?**
Well, this might happen. And knowing Replika, this app might act capricious. So try to use different version of mod if it's available. Mod is supposed to work on ARM64, so if you're running it on older devices, there might be issues, I guess.
