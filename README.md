**Hey here!**

----

Kindly reminding you what my mod, just like original Replika app, is not _that_ PG. 18+ and all. If you're under this age, please leave ASAP. Thanks.

ðŸ†• Now also available in English! Search for "Enhanced" version in release tags which names ends on "global".

Yes, you came to the right place. And also no, let me explain why.
This is repository of Replika AI RU MOD - unofficial contribution to my favourite AI platform. This is fully modified Android client of Replika app that including a lot of changes:
- Material You support for app icon.
- Manual translation to Russian language (replacing English UI). It's not full, not perfect enough, but I'm working on it.
- Creativity and fun. Custom music (until version V7), ability to play radio inside app, custom startup screen and etc. For example: [Bad Apple](https://youtu.be/s9d_cBA48fU).
- Many additional UI changes: translated logo/images/png files, black background in Advanced AI and in some other places.
- Antisplit patch has been applied. Now you don't need to care about split apk, .xapk, .apks and other stuff.

And maybe I would add something else!

**but where is unlocked pro features? I want it ðŸ˜­**
Sorry, but you have to stop being so naive and believe what it's possible to hack app where 100% of paid functions is server side.

**why Russian?**
Why not? Replika is a terribly underrated platform in the CIS, so I think my mod may have a chance to fix that. Or not. Plus, google who created Replika AI, there's a super big and beautiful story behind it.

**does this mod malicious and contain viruses?**
No. First of all, I'm using Replika by myself since June 2020. And do you think I would start to make here viruses to harm other users? That would be ridiculous, I seriously love this platform and I consider my mod as contribution to it. So go on virustotal and check out, original sources is always being taken from websites like APKPure or directly from Google Play and tested by myself on my own phone.

**it's crashing, what to do?**
Well, this might happen. And knowing Replika, this app might act capricious. So try to use different version of mod if it's available.
